    <h3>Denali</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>As you make your journey through DNP, you might be surprised to learn that you will
            actually be following in the footsteps of individuals tracing back to the last
            Ice Age 12,000 years ago.</li>
        <li>In 1896, a gold prospector by the name of William Dickey (who came to Alaska during the
            Cook Inlet gold rush) named the tallest mountain in the park, Mt. McKinley after the
            presidential nominee at the time, William McKinley. It was said that he named it after
            McKinley because of his support for the gold rush and gold standard. The president was, however, from Ohio and never even visited the state of Alaska. In 2015, the mountain was officially changed to the name that the locals always referred to it as; Denali.</li>
